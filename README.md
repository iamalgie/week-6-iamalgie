## Application Description
> The application is a simple Contact App that lets you add, save, and delete contact information. I ensure that there are no empty fields, and it collects the first name, last name, phone number, and email address of the user.

## Things you did in the code
> I use the permission for contacts to ensure it can read and write contacts in the AndroidManifest.xml file. I also ensure that the app does not accept empty fields and collects correct data. Then, I ensure it displays the correct date inputted by the user on a page. I also implemented a function that automatically pops up a page when the contact has already been deleted.

## Challenges when developing the application
> One of the biggest issues that I had is the permission in AndroidManifest.xml since it is supposed to be inside the manifest tag, not the application tag.
