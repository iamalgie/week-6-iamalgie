## Application Description
> The application is simple pseudo-shopping app that lets you add items from the cart, and checkout after you place an item.

## Things you did in the code
> Since it is from the previous snippet of the laboratory handout, I just added the checkout screen. Its features are when the checkout is clicked from the cart, it will redirect to another screen. In that screen, it will let you show all the items that you have checkout, its total cost, and the "Pay Now" button. If now items were selected, the button will not be visible.

## Challenges when developing the application
> I do have a slight confusion on managing the routes of each screens, and how it will make sense on the main.dart and the newly added file MyCheckout.dart.
